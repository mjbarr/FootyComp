# Agent Onboarding Guide

Welcome to **FootyComp**. This document explains how to work within the repository without disrupting existing functionality or look and feel.

## Repository Docs
- **requirements.txt** lists all runtime, linting and testing dependencies. Install or update them with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and modify the file when new packages are added.
- **docs/tech_spec.md** describes architecture, database models and API contracts. Review it before making structural changes.
- **docs/user_stories/** contains numbered markdown files that drive feature development. Reference the appropriate story in your commit message and keep the numbering sequence. Before coding, expand the target story with a **Technical Implementation** section outlining the specific tasks you'll perform.

## Stack & Structure
- Python 3 with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for the web layer and SQLAlchemy for ORM.
- Application code lives under `app/`:
  - `models.py` defines ORM models.
  - `routers/` holds FastAPI routers; add new endpoints in their own router modules.
  - `tests/` contains pytest tests mirroring the package structure.
- Follow existing design patterns and SOLID principles: keep modules small, use dependency injection via `Depends`, and reuse helpers from `db.py`, `fixtures.py` and `results.py` when relevant.

## Environment & Secrets
- `THE_ODDS_API_KEY` (repository secret `The-odds-api-key`) authorizes requests to the external odds API service. Retrieve it with `os.getenv("THE_ODDS_API_KEY")` and never hard-code values. In tests, mock the call or supply a dummy value.

## Competition Flow
- Weekly coupons carry `season` and `week` numbers.
- Weeks increment sequentially (1, 2, 3, ...).
- Start week numbering over at 1 when a new season begins.

## Development Workflow
1. For any behavior change, write or update tests in `app/tests/`.
2. Run `ruff check .` for linting and `pytest -q` for tests before committing.
3. Ensure UI or API changes preserve current look and feel and do not break existing contracts.

## Deployment
- Local development server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
- Production deployment should run the same app via `uvicorn` or `gunicorn` behind a process manager with a PostgreSQL database. Update configuration details in `docs/tech_spec.md` if deployment requirements change.
- The project deploys to [Render](https://render.com). Keep the `render.yaml` manifest synchronized with your changesâ€”add services, environment variables, or build commands as needed and commit updates alongside code.

Following these guidelines will help keep the project maintainable and consistent.

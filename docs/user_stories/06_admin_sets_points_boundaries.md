# User Story 06: Admin sets points allocation boundaries

As an administrator, I want to define odds-based point ranges so that picks award points according to difficulty.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Admin can add or edit minimum and maximum odds thresholds with associated point values
- Boundaries are stored in the database and applied when scoring selections
- Updates apply to future coupons only
